- title: 'Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action'
  author: Elinor Ostrom
  year: '1990'
  stars: ''
  summary: Explores how common-pool resources (resources that are rival and subtractable,
    such as irrigation systems or grazing lands) can be successfully managed by the
    people who use them, rather than being controlled by the state or private interests.
    Ostrom argues that such resources can be effectively managed through the creation
    of rules that are developed and enforced by the users themselves, avoiding a Tragedy
    of the Commons.
  whyRecommended: 'This applies not only to concrete resources like natural resources
    but also to abstract resources within a company: shared architecture, naming/nomenclature,
    common schemas, scheduling, prioritization, or the lack of any of these. The rules
    Ostrom present a way to effectively manage and protect these resources without
    falling into the perpetual struggle between top-down vs bottom-up.'

    earliest stages, primarily focused on Evaporating Clouds (later called Conflict
    Resolution Diagrams) and Current Reality Trees (later called Problem trees).

    in narrative form. Excellently shares the fundamentals in a way that subsequent
    books have not captured. Not a practitioners book but lays the ground work. Gene
    Kim's The Phoenix Project was based on this book in style and the Theory of Constraints,
    generally.

    strategy and planning within a complex system such as an organization, a project
    or even an individual. ToC LTP tools are even applied to psychology.

  whyRecommended: This version ("The Minto Pyramid Principle") is more expensive and

    problem solving. I recommend this later book but if you're not interested in spending
    as much, you'll get much of the value out of her earlier book.

    of ToC). I may remove this if H. William Dettmer's book The Logical Thinking Process
    (which is the third of these books) is better. (I haven't read it yet.)
