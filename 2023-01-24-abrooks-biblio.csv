Ostrom argues that such resources can be effectively managed through the creation of rules that are developed and enforced by the users themselves, avoiding a Tragedy of the Commons.","This applies not only to concrete resources like natural resources but also to abstract resources within a company: shared architecture, naming/nomenclature, common schemas, scheduling, prioritization, or the lack of any of these. The rules Ostrom present a way to effectively manage and protect these resources without falling into the perpetual struggle between top-down vs bottom-up.","",""
